A 'hacker' game built to learn about HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
Adapted from my iOS version of the game.

attack.html -- most recent gameplay and node editor
gametool.html -- old node editor (needs to be rewritten when we settle on a redux store)
hearpage.html -- main game page that logs into the server
